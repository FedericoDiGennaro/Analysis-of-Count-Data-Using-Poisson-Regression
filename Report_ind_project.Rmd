# Introduction 
This statistical analysis examines the relationship between the apprentice migration between 1775 and 1799 to Edinburgh from 33 regions in Scotland.
The study$^{[1]}$ utilizes the following four variables to try to predict the number of apprentices migrating:

* Distance: Distance from the region to Edinburgh. 
* Population: Population (1000s) in the region. 
* Degree_Urb: Degree of urbanization of the region (in %). 
* Direction: Categorical variables that takes value in $\{1,2,3\}$ stays for: 1=North, 2=West, 3=South. 

In this analysis, we are focusing on the number of apprentices among migrants, which we will refer to as our $\textit{Apprentices}$. It is crucial to note that our outcome variable can be classified as count data, taking only discrete values. As such, it is important to acknowledge that our outcome will not follow a normal distribution (that is continuous), and therefore, traditional linear regression methods cannot be used. Given the nature of our data, we will need to explore alternative statistical methods that are more appropriate for count data analysis. By doing so, we can ensure that our results are both accurate and reliable. From the literature otherwise, we know that Poisson regression is suitable to analyze count data (in this case our $Y$ is the number of $\textit{Apprentices}$, i.e. it can be seen as count data).
Poisson regression is in the family of the so-called Generalized Linear Models (GLM). In GLMs, the response variable is related to the linear predictor, denoted by $\eta = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + ... + \beta_k X_k$, through a link function $g(\cdot)$. The link function establishes the relationship between the linear predictor and the expected value of the response variable, denoted by $\mathbb{E}[Y|x]$, such that $g(\mathbb{E}[Y|x])=\eta$.
In the context of Poisson regression (that relies on Poisson distribution), the link function is commonly defined as $g(x)=log(x)$. This specification is particularly useful when working with count data, such as the number of apprentices among migrants in our analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Before fitting a Poisson regression model, it is important to conduct exploratory data analysis. By doing so, we can gain insights into the relationships between variables and identify any potential issues or outliers in the data.  
In our analysis, we are working with a dataset that consists of 33 observations, each corresponding to a different county in Scotland. For each observation, we have recorded values for the dependent variable of interest, denoted by $\textit{Apprentices}$, as well as the predictor variables that were introduced earlier in the report.
Conducting exploratory data analysis on this dataset can provide valuable insights into the relationships between variables and the distribution of the data. Additionally, it can help us identify any outliers or missing values that may need to be addressed before fitting the Poisson regression model.

# Display the plot
print(plot)
```
Upon examining the plot, we can observe that the distributions of the variables $\textit{Distance}$, $\textit{Population}$, and $\textit{Degree Urb}$ differ depending on the value of the factor variable $\textit{Direction}$. Additionally, it is worth noting that the variables $\textit{Distance}$ and $\textit{Population}$ exhibit significant skewness.
Given their skewed distributions, it may be beneficial to apply a logarithmic transformation to these variables before fitting our Poisson regression models. This transformation can help to reduce the effect of extreme values on the results and improve the model's performance.

```{r plot2, fig.cap = "Histogram of outcome variable Apprentices", fig.width= 10,fig.height=6}
# Generate some example data
set.seed(0)
y <- data[3]

# Plot histogram of observed y
hist(y$Apprentices, breaks=seq(0,250,10), col = "skyblue", border = "black", main = "Histogram of Observed y",
     xlab = "Value", ylab = "Frequency")

# define dependent

#hist(y$Apprentices, breaks=seq(0,250,10), main="Histogram of the outcome variable", #xlab = "Number of Apprentices", ylab = "Frequency")

```
The histogram of the dependent variable $\textit{Apprentices}$ provides insight into its empirical distribution. Upon examination of the histogram, it is evident that there is an outlier observation that deviates significantly from the others. This outlier observation can lead to issues such as over-dispersion, which can affect the accuracy of the Poisson regression model.  
It may be necessary to address this outlier observation before fitting the Poisson regression model to prevent potential issues with over-dispersion.

# Model Fitting
## Model highlights:
$$ Y = Apprentices; \;
X_1 = Distance; \;
X_2 = Population; \;
X_3 = Degree\_Urb; \;
X_4 = Direction.$$
As already said in the introduction, we will use Poisson Regression to determine whether there is or not an effect between explanatory variables $X_i, i \in \{1,2,3,4\}$ and the outcome variable $Y$.

**Model 1: Poisson regression model.**  
Let's now define the first model in the study.  
$$\textit{Model 1}: \\
Y|X_1,...,X_4 \sim Pois(\mu).$$ 
$$\mu = exp(\eta),\ \eta=\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + ... + \beta_4 X_4.$$
The coefficients $\beta_i$ of a Poisson Regression model are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. 
```{r}
poisson.model<-glm(Apprentices ~ Distance + Population + Degree_Urb + Direction, data, family=poisson(link = "log"))
# Example table data
```
The Poisson regression model (cfr. Table \ref{tab:M1} for a summary on its coefficients) in question appears to be afflicted with several issues. Firstly, as suggested in the exploratory data analysis, the model suffers from over-dispersion. To confirm this, we can fit a Quasi-Poisson model in R that outputs the estimate of the dispersion parameter $(\phi)$, which is found to be $7731.329$. This value indicates an extremely large degree of over-dispersion, as the dispersion parameter should typically be close to 1 in a Poisson regression model.  
It is essential to note that the significant coefficients in the original Poisson model may be misleading (that's why I decided to not show them here), as they are likely the result of the over-dispersion issue. The incorrect and artificially small standard errors that result from failing to adjust for over-dispersion can lead to artificially small p-values for the model coefficients.  
```{r}
poisson.model<-glm(Apprentices ~ Distance + Population + Degree_Urb + Direction, data, family=poisson(link = "log"))
```

**Model 2: Base negative binomial model.**  
It is important to note that over-dispersion can have a significant impact on the model's results, as it can lead to incorrect conclusions about the relationships between the variables. Removing the outlier observation noticed in the EDA reduces the over-dispersion but does not remove it.  
For this reason, it is better to use a model that takes it into account; this such a model can be a Quasi-Poisson model or a negative binomial model. The Quasi-Poisson model only provides a rough estimate of the dispersion parameter, so it may be necessary to consider alternative models, such as the Negative Binomial Regression model, which explicitly models over-dispersion$^{[2]}$.  
For this reason from now on I will focus on fitting a negative binomial model. I chose a negative binomial model over a quasi-poisson model because when checking if the variance and the mean are proportional in the "mean-variance plot" (or "dispersion plot"), the points does not seems to be randomly scattered around a horizontal line at zero. Recall that the coefficients of a negative binomial model are implemented using maximum likelihood estimation. 
```{r plot3, fig.cap = "mean-variance plot", fig.width= 8,fig.height=5}
data <- read_excel("data/data2.xlsx")
data$Direction <- as.factor(data$Direction)

poisson.model2<-glm(Apprentices ~ Distance + Population + Degree_Urb + Direction, data, family=poisson(link = "log"))
yhat <- predict(poisson.model2, type = "response")
plot(yhat, residuals(poisson.model2, type = "pearson"),
     xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Pearson Residuals")
```
Given that the points form a curve that slopes downward from left to right, the variance increases slower than the mean.  
The form of the model equation for negative binomial regression is the same as that for Poisson regression: the log of the outcome is predicted with a linear combination of the predictors.

$$\textit{Model 2}: \\
Y|X_1,...,X_4 \sim NegBin(\mu,\alpha).$$ 
$$\mu = exp(\eta),\ \eta=\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + ... + \beta_4 X_4, \ \alpha \text{ is the over-dispersion parameter}.$$
For a summary on coefficients of this model, please see Table \ref{tab:M2} in the Appendix.

```{r}
data <- read_excel("data/data2.xlsx")
data$Direction <- as.factor(data$Direction)
nb_model <- glm.nb(Apprentices ~ Distance + Population + 
                     Degree_Urb + Direction, data=data)
```

**Model 3: Negative binomial model with log-transformations.**  
As we previously observed in the exploratory data analysis, the variables $\textit{Distance}$ and $\textit{Population}$ exhibit skewness, which can cause issues when fitting a model. A common solution to this problem is to apply a logarithmic transformation to these variables. By doing so, we can better capture the relationship between these predictors and the response variable $\textit{Apprentices}$. Please notice that the mathematical definition of $\textit{Model 3}$ is exactly the same as the one of $\textit{Model 2}$ with the exception of the $log$ of the variables $X_1$ and $X_2$. 

Let $X_1'=log(x_1)$, $X_2'=log(x_2)$, $X_3'=X_3$, $X_4'=X_4$; hence, we can define $Model 3$ as:  
$$\textit{Model 3}: \\
Y|X_1',..,X_4' \sim NegBin(\mu,\alpha) $$ 
$$\mu = exp(\eta), \ \eta=\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1' + ... + \beta_4 X_4', \ \alpha \text{ is the over-dispersion parameter}.$$

To assess the impact of this transformation, we compare a new model, denoted $\textit{Model 3}$, to the original $\textit{Model 2}$. While these models are not nested, we can still use the AIC as a metric for model selection. A lower AIC indicates a better model fit. In this case, $\textit{Model 3}$ has a lower AIC of $166.62$ compared to $\textit{Model 2}$ with an AIC of $184.94$. This indicates that $\textit{Model 3}$ is a better fit for our data and provides stronger statistical evidence for the relationship between our predictors and the response variable.
```{r}
data <- read_excel("data/data2.xlsx")
data$Direction <- as.factor(data$Direction)

data$Distance = log(data$Distance)
colnames(data)[colnames(data) == "Distance"] <- "LogDistance"
data$Population = log(data$Population)
colnames(data)[colnames(data) == "Population"] <- "LogPopulation"

nb_model2<-glm.nb(Apprentices ~ (LogDistance + LogPopulation + Degree_Urb + Direction), data)
```
You can have a look at Table \ref{tab:M3} in the Appendix for a summary on coefficients estimated for this model.

**Model 4: Negative binomial model with log-transformations and interactions.**  
To improve the model's ability to explain the data, I have added complexity to $\textit{Model 3}$ by including interactions between all the exogenous variables. 
Let $Z_{i,j}=X_i' X_j'$  $\forall i,j=1,...4,$ $j>i$. Then we define $Model 4$ as:

$$\textit{Model 4}: \\
Y|X_1',..,X_4', Z_{1,2}, ..., Z_{3,4} \sim NegBin(\mu,\alpha).$$ 
$$\mu = exp(\eta),\ \alpha \text{ is the over-dispersion parameter}.$$

This time $\eta =  \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1' + ... + \beta_4 X_4'+ \beta_{1,2}Z_{1,2} + ... + \beta_{3,4}Z_{3,4}$
You can have a look at Table \ref{tab:M4} in the Appendix for a summary on coefficients estimated for this model.
```{r}
nb_model3<-glm.nb(Apprentices ~ (LogDistance + LogPopulation + Degree_Urb + Direction)^2, data)
``` 
To test whether $\textit{Model 4}$ is better than $\textit{Model 3}$, we can use a likelihood ratio test. 
$$\mathcal{H}_0: \text{Model 3 is true}.$$
$$\mathcal{H}_1: \text{Model 4 is true}.$$
```{r}
knitr::kable(lrtest(nb_model2, nb_model3), digits=2)
```

As we can see from the results above, the p-value of such a test is between 0.05 and 0.1 and so the result of the test crucially depends on the level of significance $\alpha$ we chose; the preferred model at a level 0.1 is $\textit{Model 4}$ but the preferred model at level 0.05 is $\textit{Model 3}$. Given that the AIC is lower for $\textit{Model 3}$ $(200 \ vs \ 166.62)$, we can argue that adding complexity does not improve too much the fitting. For this reason, the preferred model remains $\textit{Model 3}$.

**Final Model.**  
Starting from $\textit{Model 3}$, I perform a stepwise selection based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), a popular method to compare different models. In this way, we can balance the goodness-of-fit and the complexity of our model, and choose the one that best represents the underlying data-generating process.  
After the selection, the variables keept are:
$$
X_1' = log(Distance); \;
X_2' = log(Population); \;
X_3' = Degree\_Urb. \;
$$
Hence, the final model fitted is:
$$
\textit{Final Model}: \hat{y} = exp(7.33-1.81X_1'+0.83X_2'-0.02X_3').
$$
In this Final model, all the coefficients are significant at level 0.05 (cfr. Table \ref{tab:Final} in Appendix).
\newpage

# Model assessment
At this point, it is important to verify whether or not the assumptions of the $\textit{Final Model}$ (Negative Binomial Regression model) are satisfied. The assumption of a Negative Binomial Regression model are the following:  

**1)** $Y|X_1', X_2', X_3' \sim NegBin(\mu,\alpha)$ where $\mu = exp(\hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1}X_1' + \hat{\beta_2}X_2' + \hat{\beta_3}X_3')$ and $\alpha \text{ is the over-dispersion parameter}$.  
To do so, I use a diagnostic plot provided by the package $\textit{performance}$.
```{r plot4, fig.cap = "diagnostic plot for distribution", fig.width= 8,fig.height=6.5}
final_model<-stepAIC(nb_model2, direction = "both", trace = FALSE)
plot(check_distribution(final_model))
```
From the above plot, we can see that the distribution that better fits the data is a negative binomial. Using the usual euristic to check wheter or not it is better to fit a zero-inflated model, it turns out that there is no such a big evidence to do so.  

**2)** The observations are independent.  
There is no way to check this assumption because it depends on how the data were collected; we have to assume that it is true.

**3)** There is a linear relationship between log count and linear predictor.  
```{r plot5, fig.cap = "diagnostic plot of residuals vs fitted", fig.width= 8,fig.height=6.5}

# Extract the residuals and linear predictor values
residuals <- residuals(final_model, type = "pearson")
linear_predictor <- predict(final_model, type = "link")

# Create a scatter plot of the residuals versus linear predictor values
plot(linear_predictor, residuals, xlab = "Linear Predictor", ylab = "Residuals",
     main = "Residuals vs Linear Predictor Plot")

# Add a horizontal line at y=0 to indicate the zero line
abline(h = 0, lty = 2)

# Check for any patterns or trends in the scatter plot
```
The residuals are randomly scattered around the zero line and no evident pattern is shown in this diagnostic plot. For this reason, the assumption of a linear relationship between log count and linear predictor is met.
